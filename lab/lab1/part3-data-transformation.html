    # Lab 1, Part 3 â€” Data Transformation

    ## Introduction

    We're going to explore Philadelphia Bike Share locations. We will be using
    data from OpenDataPhilly (https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/bike-share-stations).

    We have converted the data from OpenDataPhilly into an array of arrays
    similar to part3. However, our arrays for bike share data have an extra data
    point:

    1. lat
    2. lng
    3. label
    4. number of bike share docks at the station

    This data is assigned to variable "data" in the code below. You can view the
    entire array in the part4-data-clean.js file.

    ## Data Processing

    We are only interested in bike share stations with more than 20 docks.
    Programmatically create a new array, variable "dataFiltered" that only
    contains locations with more than 20 docks. Hint: you should try using
    the Array `push()` method.

    ## Add Markers to the map

    Loop through this filtered array, adding all markers to the map.

    ## Working with Dirty Data

    Often, our data will contain inconsistencies that can cause problems in our
    code. In the code below, switch out "bikeArrayClean" with "bikeArrayDirty".
    If you reload your map now, the markers should be gone. You can review the
    dirty data in part4-data-dirty.js.

    Without modifying part4-data-dirty.js, change your code to account for the
    dirty data. Note: it is okay if your new code ignores a few of the points,
    if their formatting is especially wrong. But it should accommodate most points.

//BASICALLY OBTAINED FROM http://adripofjavascript.com/blog/drips/filtering-arrays-with-array-filter.html:
    var dataFiltered = []; //First creates the initially empty ARRAY variable since [] means empty array

    for (var i = 0; i < data.length ; i++) {
        if (data[i][3] > 20) { //Loop statement which selects out any sub-array (bike station) with more than 20 docks (the "third" element of each sub-array shows each station's dock amount)
            dataFiltered.push(data[i]); //Pushes the sub-arrays that meet the criteria above to the dataFiltered variable, turning dataFiltered from empty to populated with the sub-arrays from the data variable which meet the criteria above
        }
    }

  console.log(dataFiltered) //It works

      }

    for (var i=0; i <dataFiltered.length; i = i+1) {
