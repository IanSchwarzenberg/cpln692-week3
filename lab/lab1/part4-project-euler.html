    # Lab 1, Part 4 â€” Stretch Goal: Project Euler

    ## Introduction

    Practice your Javascript and math skills by solving a problem on Project
    Euler. Project Euler is a series of challenging math and computer science
    problems that can be solved using any language (for our class, use
    Javascript).

    Solve the first problem on this page https://projecteuler.net/archives
    (Multiples of 3 and 5). To check your answer, create an account and you will
    be able to submit your final result.

    If you complete problem 1, move on to problem 2!

    /* =====================

    Start code

    ===================== */

//Problem 1:
//BASICALLY OBTAINED FROM https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/77018/project-euler-1-javascript:
var multiples = []; //First creates an initially blank array variable called multiples to store all the numbers under 1000 that are multiples of 3 or 5
var answer = 0; //Creates a variable which will store the answer (the sum of the numbers that will be in the multiples variable) which is temporarily set to 0

for (var i = 1; i < 1000; i++) { //Makes it so only all numbers under 1000 are being initially considered
    if (i % 3 === 0 || i % 5 === 0) { //Means "if a number under 1000 is a multiple of 3 OR (||) a multiple of 5, then..."
        multiples.push(i); //If a number under 1000 ends up fitting the criteria above (being a multiple of 3 or 5), then it gets PUSHED (added to) the now formerly empty multiples variable
        answer += i; //"+= i" loops through all the numbers now stored in the multiples variable and ADDS THEM TOGETHER ("+=" means adding values to each other)
    }
}

console.log(answer); //Prints the sum of all those multiples (the final answer) of 233168 to the console

//Problem 2:
//BASICALLY OBTAINED FROM https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39178973/project-euler-2-fibonacci-javascript-attemp:
var fib = [0,1]; //Creates an array which serves as the starting point of the fibonacci sequence creation process because 0 and 1 are the first 2 numbers to start adding. 0+1=1, then 1+1=2, 2+1=3, etc.
var i = 0; //Similar to say "for (var i=0...)" which sets the starting point of the index to 0 to be used in the while statement
var answer = 0; //Makes the essentially empty variable which the answer will be stored in.
while (fib[0]+fib[1] < 4000000){ //Establishes the condition that the first 2 numbers in any fibonacci sequence calculation can not add up to anything more than 4000000 to make sure all values included do not exceed 4000000.
    i= fib[0]+fib[1]; //Makes sure the sequence always adds the previous two terms throughout the entire sequnce of fibonacci numbers up to 4000000.
    fib[0]=fib[1]; //Further makes the loop statement constantly advance through the sequence adding the previous 2 terms together. Ex. first 0 and 1 are added, then 1 and 1 are added next. This line is responsible for propelling that process forward through the sequence by constantly overwriting the previous values.
    fib[1]=i; //This further propels that process forward through the sequence by constantly updating the index to start the process in the line directly above this again.
        if(i%2 === 0){ // Isolates all of the even fibonacci sequence numbers less than 4000000 stored in i. It goes through all of the fibonacci numbers (even and odd) from 1 to 4000000 stored in i and asks if they are evenly (no remainder) divisible by 2 (even)
        answer += i; //If a number is even, then it gets brought to the new answer variable. Then this while statement sums up all of those even numbers from i that were isolated in the line above to get the final answer.
    }
}
console.log(answer); //Prints the final answer of 4613732 to the console
